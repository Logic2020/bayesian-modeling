# Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling 
(also called multilevel modeling)

## Definition & Background:
Def: a statistical model used on data with a nested or hierarchy structure that estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution using the Bayesian method

## Intuition Behind Method:
The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution.  The observational data is expressed in the form of a likelihood function. These are combined to determine the standardized posterior distribution, which can be used for making predictions about future events.

## Use Cases of Bayesian:

## Steps:
### Key Terms ###
**Posterior Distribution** = 

### _Stage I: likelihood or Individual-level Model_ ###

### _Stage II: Prior or Population Model_ ###

### _Stage III: Hyperprior_ ###
